# ðŸ¤– Generative AI Webpage
This project aims to showcase the integration of generative text and image AI models, specifically Google Gemini and Stable Diffusion. By combining these two powerful AI technologies, the webpage can both text and image contents dynamically.

## Features:
### Text Generation with Google Gemini:
Utilizing Google Gemini, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Text is generated based on user prompts to provide diverse contents and meet different needs.
### Image Generation with Stable Diffusion:
Utilizing Stable Diffusion, a cutting-edge image generation model, to create high-quality and realistic images. Images can be generated based on the generated text or user prompts to complement the textual content.
